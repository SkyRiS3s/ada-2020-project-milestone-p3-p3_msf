# 1. Title
The effect of the Black Lives Matter movement on the arrests of African American people in L.A.


# 2. Abstract
The purpose of our study is to observe the effect of the creation of the Black Lives Matter social movement on the arrests of African Americans. The movement was first created in July 2013, after George Zimmerman (an American citizen) was acquitted for shooting and killing Trayvon Martin, an African American of 17 years old.
To assess this question, we will perform a segmented regression analysis as it was done in the "Chilling Effects: Online Surveillance and Wikipedia Use" paper. Our goal is to show whether or not there is a change in the trend of the overall arrests of African Americans in L.A. since the creation of the movement in the U.S. We will also study the evolution of the arrests of the other races, in order to compare them with the trend of the arrests of African American people. 
As for the dataset we intend on using for our study, we will work on [Los Angeles Crime & Arrest Data](https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-crime-arrest-data?select=crime-data-from-2010-to-present.csv) which is provided by the City of Los Angeles.

# 3. Research Questions
- Since the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement, was there a change in the trend of the overall arrests of African American people in L.A.?
- How does the evolution of the trend of arrests of the other races differ from those of the African American people ?
- Is there a difference in the number of arrestations between males and females African Americans ? What about after the Black Lives Matter movement ?

# 4. Proposed dataset
The dataset is hosted by the city of Los Angeles. The organization has an open data platform and they update their information according the amount of data that is brought in.

It contains information regarding the arrestations for each day from 2010 to 2019, the type of crime, the sex, race and age of the arrested person, etc.
